You can deploy this project using Heroku.  treatmentcells.csv is provided as an example.  That determines how many of what gets allocated to mturkers.  It will mark these cells as finished as the project progresses.

If you want to run a new treatments you need to upload a new csv of treatmentcells with a "batch" name that has not been used.  The current example uses "exp1".   Also you need to set the variable _BATCH='newbatchname'
